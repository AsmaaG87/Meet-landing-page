## My process

### Built with

- **Semantic HTML5 markup** - Clean, accessible structure
- **CSS3** with modern features:
  - **Flexbox** - For flexible layouts and alignment
  - **CSS Grid** - For complex image gallery layouts with grid-template-areas
  - **Custom properties** - For consistent color schemes
  - **Multiple media queries** - Mobile-first responsive design
- **Mobile-first workflow** - Starting from 375px and scaling up
- **Google Fonts** - Red Hat Display typography
- **Background overlays** - Linear gradients combined with background images



### Key Challenges Overcome

1. **Grid Template Areas Syntax** - Understanding that each quoted string represents a row, not individual items
2. **Flexbox Item Reordering** - Using `display: contents` to break flex container behavior while maintaining element order
3. **Responsive Image Sizing** - Balancing fixed dimensions with responsive behavior across breakpoints
4. **Button Layout in Flex Rows** - Preventing button stretching when the parent container changes to a row layout
5. **Background Image Paths** - Ensuring proper asset loading across different environments
